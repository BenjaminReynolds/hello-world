# Hello World!

  This repository will be home to many random notes and project ideas. Mainly it is used to hold code snippets in the different languages that I use as a reference point. For example, a quick "Hello World!" script in each language I have learned. It is also used as a playground to familiarize myself with git and the github platform.
