;; Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:
;; Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the
;; procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of nn. For example,
;; (k n) computes 5n^2.

(define (f n) (A 0 n)) ;; => 2n
(define (g n) (A 1 n)) ;; => 2^n
(define (h n) (A 2 n)) ;; => 2^2^... (n - 1 times)
(define (k n) (* 5 n n)) ;; => 5n^2

;; I cheated a bit on this one because I feel its teaching more math than it is
;; teaching computers science.
