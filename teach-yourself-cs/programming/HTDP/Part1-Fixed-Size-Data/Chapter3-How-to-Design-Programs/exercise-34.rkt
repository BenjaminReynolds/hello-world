; Exercise 34. Design the function string-first, which extracts the first character from a non-empty string. Donâ€™t worry about empty strings.

; We use strings to represent words

; String -> 1String (or character)
; returns the first 1String in str
; given: "hello world", expect: "h"
; given: "awesome", expect: "a"
(define (string-first str)
  (string-ith str 0))
